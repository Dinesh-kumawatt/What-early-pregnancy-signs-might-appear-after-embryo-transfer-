After embryo transfer many people anxiously watch for early clues of pregnancy, but signs vary widely and are not definitive. Common early symptoms include mild implantation spotting or cramping about 6–12 days after transfer, breast tenderness, increased fatigue, nausea, and mild bloating. Some experience increased vaginal discharge or temporary changes in appetite and mood. However, many of these symptoms overlap with the effects of progesterone support used after IVF, and stress or anticipation can also amplify bodily sensations. The most reliable way to confirm pregnancy after transfer is a serum beta-hCG blood test performed on the clinic’s recommended day (commonly 10–14 days post-transfer). If positive, follow-up beta-hCG trends and early ultrasound help assess viability. Until tests confirm pregnancy, it’s helpful to rest, avoid strenuous activity, continue prescribed medications, and maintain regular communication with your fertility team for personalized guidance.
